1. What is Git?
    Git is a version control system
        => Records changes made to our code overtime and store them in a repository.
        * Centralized: all team members are connected to a single center server
        * Distributed: every team member has a copy of the project

2. Using Git:
    -> Command line
    -> Code Editer
    -> Graphical user interfaces

3. Creating Snapshots:
    git init                                ==> Initialize a repository
    rm .git                                 ==> Remove .git file (losing project history)

    git add ...                             ==> Add files to the staging area
    (We review our changes, if everything is good)
    git commit -m "MESAGE..."               ==> Take a snapshot of our code and store it in the repository
    (after committing the changes, the staging area contains the same snapshot in our repository)
    git commit -am "Message..."             ==> Skipping staging area
    git ls-files                            ==> Get all files in the staging area
    rm fileName                             ==> Removes fileName only from working directory (not a git command)
    git rm fileName                         ==> Removes fileName from both working directory and staging area
    git mv fileName newFileName             ==> Rename a file in one go (deletion & adding)
    git rm --cached logss/                  ==> Remove logss folder from staging area
    
    git status                              ==> Show the status of the project
    git status -s                           ==> Show short statuses in two colomns (staging area | working directory)
        M: Modified
        A: Added
        ?: Untracked

    git diff --staged                       ==> View staged changes
    git diff                                ==> Compares working directory with staging area (unstaged changes)
    git difftool                            ==> Compares working directory with staging area in VSCode

    git log                                 ==> Show commits from latest to oldest
    git log --oneline                       ==> Short description of the commits
    git log --oneline --reverse             ==> Short description of the commits from oldest
    
    git show ...                            ==> Shows a specific commit details
    (here we specify the commit identifier or we use the HEAD pointer)
    git ls-tree ...                         ==> Shows files & folders in a commit
    (here we specify the commit identifier or we use the HEAD pointer)
    
    git restore --staged fileName           ==> Restore changes from staging area to working directory
    (when restoring, git takes a snapshot from the last commit and put it in the staging area)
    git restore ...                         ==> Undo local changes
    (git takes a snapshot of these files in the staging area and put them in our working directory)
    git clean -fd                           ==> Undo local changes (for untracked files)
    git restore --source=HEAD~1 fileName    ==> Restore fileName from a specific commit

    *** Git Objects:
        -> Commits
        -> Blobs (files)
        -> Trees (directories)
        -> Tags
        
4. Browsing History:
    git log --stat                          ==> Shows details of the commits with number of insertions & deletions for each one
    git log --patch                         ==> Shows details of the commits line by line
    git log -3                              ==> View last 3 commits
    git log --author="name"                 ==> Filter commits by name
    git log --after="date"                  ==> Filter commits by date (after, before)
    git log --grep="word"                   ==> Filter commits by the words message
    git log --pretty=format:""              ==> Format log output
        -> %an = author name
        -> %H  = commit hash
        -> %h  = abbreviated commit hash
        -> %cd = commit date

    git config --global alias.name "log --pretty=format:''" ==> Create custom console logs / actions...

    git diff HEAD~2 HEAD                    ==> Get changes between these two commits

    HEAD -> master -> last commit -> before last commit -> ... -> first commit
    git checkout (identifier)               ==> HEAD now points to (indentifier)
    (detached HEAD state HEAD detached from master, in this situation we should not create new commits, only view the code)
